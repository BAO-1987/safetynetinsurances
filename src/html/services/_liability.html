        Liability coverage is essential for any driver, providing financial protection if you are legally responsible
        for injuring someone or damaging their property in an auto accident. This coverage is a mandatory requirement in
        most states and helps cover the costs of lawsuits and claims filed against you. It's designed to protect your
        financial assets in the event that you are found at fault in a collision.

        <p>
          Coverage is only up to the limit specified in your policy, which can mean significant out-of-pocket expenses
          if damages exceed these limits.
