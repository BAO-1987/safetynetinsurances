        Collision coverage is specifically designed to cover damages to your vehicle resulting from a collision, whether
        it's with another vehicle or an object like a light pole or fence. This type of insurance is crucial for drivers
        in high-traffic areas or those who frequently navigate busy roads. It ensures that you can afford repairs or
        replacements without facing financial difficulties.
