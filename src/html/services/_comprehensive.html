        Comprehensive coverage offers financial protection against damages to your vehicle that aren't caused by a
        collision. It's designed to cover incidents that are often out of your control, such as environmental damage or
        vandalism. This type of insurance is essential for covering unexpected risks that can lead to costly repairs.

        <p>
          A deductible must be paid out-of-pocket before coverage kicks in, which can be a significant amount depending
          on
          your policy terms.
